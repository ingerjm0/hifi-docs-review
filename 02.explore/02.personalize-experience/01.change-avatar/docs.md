When you first use High Fidelity, you will be wearing the default avatar, Woody. Your avatar is a representation of you in the metaverse. You can control how your avatar moves and speak to other users in-world using it.

## Use Your Own Custom Avatar

You can use an avatar that you created. Learn more about how you can create your avatar [here](../../../create/avatars/create-avatars).

>>>>>All avatars must be hosted in the cloud before they can be used with High Fidelity. Examples of cloud storage options include Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Github, or Microsoft Azure. Alternatively, you can [add your avatar to the Marketplace](../../../marketplace/sell/add-item) to sell to other users. 

Once you have your avatar's .fst file, you can upload it. 

1. In Interface, pull up your tablet or HUD and click on **Avatar**. 
2. In the **Avatar** window, click the link icon next to your current avatar. ![](avatar-link.png)
3. Enter the .fst file's URL and click 'Confirm'.
4. If you want to access this avatar later without loading the .fst file information again, you can click on 'Add to Favorites' to save the current avatar information.
