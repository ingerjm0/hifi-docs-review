## Our Marketplace Apps

We've listed some of the apps we created and how you can use them. 

### Spectator Cam

The Spectator Camera is a camera you can use, along with recording software such as [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/), to record or livestream what you and your friends do in High Fidelity. 

>>>>> You can use the Spectator Camera only while using an HMD.

You can record or livestream what you see through your Spectator Camera using OBS. Check out their [official overview guide](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/official-overview-guide.402/) for more details.

* Search for the Spectator Camera and get it. 
* You will be prompted about running the camera script. Click Yes and check your Tablet to see if the Spectator app has been added.

>>> While using the Spectator Camera, Interface's framerate might be affected. This is because Interface is rendering not only what you see, but what the Spectator Camera sees as well.
