In High Fidelity, your experiences are shaped the world around you. When you enter a domain, all of the space around you is built with [entities](../../create/entities), or the building blocks of your environments. The walls of your room, the tree in the distance, or the animated butterfly that flew past are all entities. 

Just like in the real world, you can interact with your environment by grabbing items or colliding with objects.
