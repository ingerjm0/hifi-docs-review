## Buying High Fidelity Coin

High Fidelity Coin (HFC) isnâ€™t like other coins. You can buy it with U.S. dollars (USD) and you can cash HFC out to USD. The Bank of High Fidelity manages the number of coins and we gradually increase the number of coins in circulation as the economy grows. 100 HFC is equal to 1 USD.

To get HFC: 
1. [Book an appointment](https://calendly.com/highfidelity) at the Bank of High Fidelity.
2. At the time of your appointment, visit the [Trading Room](https://hifi.place/TradingRoom) domain.
3. Make your payment using PayPal to <finance@highfidelity.com>. The time it takes for the payment to process is based on PayPal rules and guidelines.

You can also receive HFC from gifts from your friends or as prizes at events in High Fidelity.

## Shopping the Marketplace

The Marketplace contains all types of items to enrich your VR experience, including avatars, buildings, apps, wearables, toys and so much more. Each item will have a cost associated with it - some items are free, while others can be purchased.
