You're almost done!

Now remember when we introduced High Fidelity, we mentioned that it is an open-source project? 

High Fidelity's code repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi). Interface and the servers are implemented as programs written in C++. When you execute a JavaScript program, your API calls are mapped to the objects in C++. The interface between C++ and JavaScript is provided by a cross-platform, open-source runtime environment called [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). 

You can contribute too! If you're interested in developing for us, contact us through work list! 

If you want to create and explore in High Fidelity, learn more [here](../../../create-and-explore).
