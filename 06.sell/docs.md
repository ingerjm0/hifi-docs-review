High Fidelity encourages you to [create and build experiences](../create) that you can share with others. Take the opportunity to share your creations, sell them to others, and make money in the metaverse with the Marketplace. 

There is no fee to post your items for sale on the Marketplace. We help you host and certify your content, and we process your transactions and payments. In return, you retain 90% of each sale of your item, while we keep a 10% revenue share.

Throughout this chapter, learn how you can upload your items to the Marketplace and make them available for purchase to all users in High Fidelity:

* [Add Items to the Marketplace](./add-item)
* [Update Your Marketplace Item](./update-item)
* [Ownership of Your Items](./own-item)
* [Marketplace Bill of Rights](./bill-of-rights)
* [Marketplace Submission Rules](./submission-rules)
* [Certified App Design Guidelines](./certified-apps)
