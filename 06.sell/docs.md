Learn how you can upload your items to the Marketplace and be made available for purchase to all users in High Fidelity.

There is no fee to post your items for sale on the Marketplace. We help you host and certify your content, and we process your transactions and payments. In return, you retain 90% of each sale of your item, while we keep a 10% revenue share.
