Once you've created an avatar, wearable or entity, you have the option to sell it in the Marketplace. This guide walks you through the steps to upload it to the Marketplace so that you can start the process of having it reviewed and published. 
>>>>>Prior to adding your item to the Marketplace, we recommend that you use the [Marketplace Item Tester](../../create/tools#marketplace-item-tester) to ensure that your item works the way you expected and does not have any script errors.

## Additional Notes
Follow these guidelines when uploading content to the Marketplace: 

1. Use only content which you are legally entitled to.
2. Do not use a code obfuscator, our review team needs to be able to read your scripts.
3. Audio should sound clean and be 32 bit, 48 khz wav files.
4. If your item is an object that must be rezzed by a script, attach that script to a dummy object, export it as a .JSON and use that as your main file.
5. All entities must have a name, even if they are invisible or simple primitives.
6. Please use English in your package description, support text, and code comments.
7. If needed, you may use HTML tags in your description text.
8. We recommend to link to your website, email, social media or other resource.
