## Add Your 3D Model

Once you've created your 3D model, you need to add the item and its assets in the Marketplace. At a minimum, your model will need the following assets:

* FBX file
* JSON file

### Prepare Your FBX File

1. Export your file as an FBX file from your 3D modeling program. Do not export it as a default file type such as .mb or .blend.
2. If supported by your 3D modeling software, embed your textures into your FBX file to keep the process simpler.
3. As a practice and to catch any errors, re-import your FBX back into a new scene and check that it still looks right. Look for things like missing textures or normals, and smoothing issues. You may need to tweak your export settings if the re-imported model does not look right.

### Add Your 3D Model Assets
If your model could be re-imported without any issues, it is now ready to be uploaded to High Fidelity. 

1. Go to [https://highfidelity.com/marketplace/items/new](https://highfidelity.com/marketplace/items/new) to create a new item. If you're not logged in, you will be prompted to do so. 
2. Enter your model's name and select your category. You can add the metadata now or later. 
3. Click 'Save Draft'. 
4. Scroll down to the Assets section. 
5. If your 3D model contains only an FBX file, click "Choose Files" and navigate to where your 3D model has been saved on your computer. Upload your FBX file. If your 3D model contains multiple files like scripts or textures, click "Choose Folder" and navigate to where your 3D model has been saved on your computer. Upload all related folders, including your FBX file. 
6. Click your uploaded FBX file and copy the new Marketplace URL for the FBX file. ![](copy-fbx-url.png)

### Generate Your Item's JSON File

1. In Interface, pull up your tablet or HUD and select Create.
2. In the Create Tools app, click on the Model icon to import your 3D model. 
3. Enter the URL you copied in step 6. You can only do this in a domain where you have the permission to add an entity.
2. Once your model appears before your avatar, check it and make any adjustments needed. Look for missing textures or normals, smoothing issues, issues with the scale of the model, and rotation problems. Make any changes in your 3D modeling software. Once your model looks as expected in High Fidelity, you are now ready to export your model data into a JSON file. Keep in mind that different types of software render models differently.
3. Back in the Create Tools app, find your model in the Entity List. While holding the <kbd class="keyboard">CTRL</kbd>, select any other files that are are associated with your item.
4. Click 'Export Selection' and enter a name for your JSON. This JSON file contains information on how High Fidelity can access your item and its files, and needs to contain a reference to your item's location. 
5. Open your JSON file in a text editor and check if the variable `modelURL` contains your FBX file's Marketplace URL. If it doesn't, you can edit it and paste the correct URL. ![](model-json-url.png)

### Upload Your Item's JSON File
1. In High Fidelity, verify that your model looks correct. Open the Create Tools app, then click 'Import Entities (.JSON)' and navigate to your model's JSON file. 
2. Go to [https://highfidelity.com/marketplace](https://highfidelity.com/marketplace). If you're not logged in, you will be prompted to do so.
