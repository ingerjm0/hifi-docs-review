Once your sandbox is setup, you'll want to upload your content (3D models, avatars or scripts). To do so, you'll need to host your content on a server. 
We've listed a few options where you can host your content. You can use these or any other options of your choice:

* [S3 on AWS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/GetStartedWithS3.html)
* [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/)
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
* FTP server
* Personal web server (any web provider that offers you web space)
* [Dreamhost](https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/en-us/categories/202186687-Getting-Started)
