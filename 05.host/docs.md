High Fidelity enables you to host your own domain where you can create, add, and edit content and have visitors. We invite you to create your own High Fidelity experience by creating a domain tailored to suit your needs. 

You can create a domain to host an event, as a place to hangout with friends, or even as an office space. This chapter details how you can set up a domain, secure and host it, and make it accessible to other users.
