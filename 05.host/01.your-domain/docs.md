Your domain is your own personal virtual world. In it, you can express your creativity and host your own content, with the option to share it with the world. Before you start creating content, you will need to install, configure, and secure your domain to control how other users will interact with your environment. 

**In This Section:**

+ [Install Your Domain](./install-domain)
