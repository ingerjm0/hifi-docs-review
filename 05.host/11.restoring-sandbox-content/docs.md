*Learn how to restore the entities in your sandbox, or your entire sandbox from your computer to another.*

## Overview

This page details how you can backup and restore your sandbox and sandbox content. 

##Introduction

Depending on your requirements, you can either
- [Backup archives of content in your sandbox](../restoring-sandbox-content/backup-entities): This means all the objects you either created in your domain or the ones you imported. Once you create this backup, you can create a new domain and upload all your entities.  
- [Backup your entire sandbox](../restoring-sandbox-content/backup-sandbox): This means you will be backing up all the information about your sandbox. When you do this, you can restore your entire sandbox including server information, as it was. It doesn't only include the entities in your sandbox. 

Check out how you can do both!
