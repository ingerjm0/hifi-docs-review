3. You can use one of the content archives or scroll down and generate a new one by clicking 'Generate New Archive'.
4. To download the backup folders, click the three dots under 'Actions' for the archive you chose. 
5. Click 'Download'. You will be prompted to save a folder with all content information on your computer.
