## Overview

When you first use High Fidelity, you will be wearing the default avatar. Your avatar is a representation of you in the metaverse. You can control how your avatar moves and speak to other users in-world using it. 

### The Default Avatar

When you first use High Fidelity, you will be wearing the default avatar. This is the avatar worn by all first-time users and anyone who wishes to continue doing so. 

The default avatar resembles a human, and is bipedal. High Fidelity only supports bipedal avatars. Whether you are using an HMD or are in Desktop mode, you can control your avatar's movements and make its mouth move when you speak. This also allows you to explore the metaverse and interact with other users.

You can make your time in High Fidelity unique by [creating an avatar of your own](../create-avatars). 

### Glossary

As we delve deeper into changing and creating avatars, we may use terminology that you are unfamiliar with. Here are some terms you might see:

* Avatar - A virtual representation of a person or NPC.
* Mesh - The topology for an avatar model. Without this, the avatar is invisible.
* Bones - A component of a skeleton that defines a "limb" such as an arm, leg, etc. Each bone may be animated as a separate limb in your avatar.
* Skeleton - A hierarchy of joints.
* Rigging - The process of creating a skeleton of the avatar model.
* Weights - The definition which defines how each bone in the skeleton affects the mesh.
* Skinning - The act of painting weights for the skeleton.
* UV mapping/unwrapping - The process of defining how the topology maps to a 2D texture.
* Shapekeys/blendshapes - Variations of the topology that defines how the mesh is modified to create various "shapes".
* FST (Faceshift Transform File) - The file type of an avatar, which defines the design and interactions of your avatar.
* End Users - Anyone who uses the avatar. 
* Avatar Base - The basic avatar without any custom modifications.
