## Overview

The steps involved in creating your avatar are:

1. Create an avatar with 3D character modeling tool such as Adobe Fuse. 
2. Rig and animate your avatar with an animation tool such as Mixamo.
3. Fine tune your avatar using a tool such as Blender or Maya.
4. Package the model in High Fidelity for use as an avatar.

>>>>>Many of our community members have created basic skeletons and avatars that you can use as a starting point. If you use one of these, you can skip one or more of the steps above. 

Check out this YouTube playlist for one way to create and customize your own avatar. Here, we use Adobe Fuse to create our avatar, Mixamo to rig our avatar automatically, and Blender to adjust the rendering on our avatar. We also have written instructions on the same process: 

* [Create an Avatar with Fuse](fuse-tutorial)
* [Rig Your Avatar in Mixamo](mixamo-tutorial)
