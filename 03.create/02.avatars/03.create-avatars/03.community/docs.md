## Overview

As you're creating your avatar, remember that High Fidelity is an open-source project. Many of our community members have created plug-ins, add-ons, toolkits, skeletons and more to help you create content, including avatars. Here are a few for you to play around with.

### [Blender Add-on by Menithal](https://github.com/Menithal/Blender-Hifi-Addon)

Plugin ("Project Hermes") is a plugin for Blender to allow for easier content creation and importing for the High Fidelity Metaverse Platform. It features: 

- **Material Tools**: Allows for easier pipeline to apply materials to objects so that they are ready to use in High Fidelity.
- **Armature Tools**: Adds a skeleton that is compatible with High Fidelity and let you configure bone names for use in advanced scripts.
- **Avatar Converters**: Translates and fixes models and materials from MMD and Mixamo so that they work in High Fidelity.
- **Export Tools**: Exports avatars and scenes so that they can be used in High Fidelity.
- **Import Tools**: Imports primitive entities from High Fidelity so that you can make modifications to them.
