## Overview

The High Fidelity Interface comes with a collection of **default scripts** designed to improve your experience as a user and provide you with the tools you need to be a High Fidelity developer. 

## View Running and Available Scripts

To see the list of scripts currently running or available, go to **Edit > Running Scripts** or press **Ctrl + J** to open the *Running Scripts* window.

Just below the **Reload All** and **Remove All** buttons is the list of currently running scripts. When you first start Interface, it runs a number of default scripts. These scripts are listed in this window.

Below the running scripts, you will see a file browser that shows other available scripts. 

For more information about how to run scripts in Interface, see [Running Scripts in Interface](../run-scripts).

## Default Scripts

The following chart lists the scripts run by default and provides a brief description of what each script does.

| Script              | Description                              | Usage Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `defaultScripts.js` | This is a default script that will set your enviroment before you begin to use Interface. | For information on starting and stopping scripts, see [Running Scripts in Interface](../run-scripts). |

## Available Scripts

In addition to the scripts run when you first launch, High Fidelity also provides a number of additional scripts to help you improve your user experience and provide tools for developing your own content.

| Scripts Folder | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `developer`    | The scripts found here have been created for internal use and debugging, but are available as advanced developers may find them useful when creating content. These scripts are not "entry-level" and are not guaranteed to work or be documented.|
| `system`       | Here, you will find the scripts run by default. Making changes to these scripts is not recommended, nor is it easy, as you may need 'administrative' privileges. |
| `tutorials`    | These are scripts that provide examples of what you can do using scripts in High Fidelity. For example, the `butterfly.js` script used in the [create butterflies](https://wiki.highfidelity.com/wiki/Create_butterflies) tutorial is found here. |
