Wearables are objects that attach to your avatar. They can be hats, skirts, glasses, headphones and anything else that can accessorize your look in-world. You can express your individuality by creating wearables of your own and putting them on. 

Before you can use a custom wearable, you must first host its FBX and JSON files in a place that is publicly accessible to High Fidelity.  You can use any cloud platforms including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, Dropbox, etc.
