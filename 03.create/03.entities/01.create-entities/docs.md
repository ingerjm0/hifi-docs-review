We are continually surprised by the ingentuity and creativity of the content creators in our community. You too can join this community by creating new entities. The easiest way to start building is to use High Fidelity's Create Tools app. 

>>>>>You can only use the Create Tools app in domains where you have the permission to build. 

To add a new entity to your domain: 
1. In Interface, pull up your tablet or HUD and go to Create.
2. In the Create Tools app, select the [type of entity](#types-of-entities) you want to create.
3. Depending on the entity type, the behavior will be different:  
	* For model and material entities, enter the URL that you want to import.  
	* For all other  entities, an entity with the default settings will appear in front of your avatar.
4. Edit the properties of your entity so that it [looks](../edit-entities) and [behaves](../entity-physics) like you want it to.
