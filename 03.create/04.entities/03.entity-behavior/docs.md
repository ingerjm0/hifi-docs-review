title: Define an Entity's Behavior

An entity's behavior controls its interactions with other entities and avatars in High Fidelity. Can an entity be grabbed, does it collide with other entities and avatars, or can a change in the domain's gravity affect it? You can check and change an entity's behavior by editing its properties.

## Set an Entity to Respond to Physics

If you want an entity to respond to physics or other entities and avatars, you need to make it dynamic. This allows a box to respond to gravity or a ball to bounce when it hits the floor. If an entity is not dynamic, it is static and has no gravity and no velocity. It can only be moved by a user.  

To make an entity dynamic:

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create**.
2. Select your entity on the Entity List window or just click on it. 
3. Go to the Properties tab, scroll down to "Collisions" and check "Dynamic".

## Set Entity Behavior on Collision

When an entity has no collision properties, it moves through other entities and avatars like it's not a solid object. For an entity to collide when it comes in contact with another entity or avatar, its collision properties need to be changed. With the entity selected, click on Properties and scroll down to the Collision settings. Here are the different collision settings you can configure:

| Collides With      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Static Entities    | Your entity will collide with static entities. Keep in mind that if your entity is a static entity, it will not collide with another static entity. Only a dynamic entity can collide with a static entity. |
| Kinematic Entities | Your entity will collide with kinematic entities. Kinematic entities have velocity, but are not dynamic. Their behavior is controlled by an external script. |
| Dynamic Entities   | Your entity will collide with other dynamic entities.        |
| My avatar          | Your entity will collide with your avatar.                   |
| Other avatars      | Your entity will collide with other user's avatars.          |
| Collision Sound    | You can [make your entity emit a sound](../add-sounds) whenever it collides with other entities. |

## Make an Entity Grabbable

Your entity's grab properties determine how it behaves when you or another user interacts with it. By default, **Grabbable** and **Follow Controller** are checked. Here are the different grab settings you can configure:

| Behavior          | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Grabbable         | You or other users can grab this entity.                     |
| Follow Controller | Your entity will follow the movements of your hand controller instead of your avatar's hands. If your avatar's arms are shorter than your real arms, your entity will be grabbed where the controller is (at a distance from your avatar's hands). |

## Set an Entity to Trigger Scripts

If you want your entity to trigger a script when you, other users, or other entities come in contact with it, you can do so by editing its properties. Here are the different trigger settings you can configure:

| Behavior    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Triggerable | Your entity can trigger a script. For instance, you can trigger a cube entity to run a script asking for a tip every time you click it. |

## Make an Entity Cloneable

You can clone your entity to create other entities with the same properties as yours. While creating clones, you can set how long they'll exist, how many clones you can create, how the clone responds to physics, and if the clone is an avatar entity. Here are the different clone settings you can configure:

| Behavior                          | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cloneable                         | Your entity can be cloned. You can change the Clone settings to manipulate your cloned entity's behavior. |
| *Cloneable:* Clone Lifetime       | Select this option to set how long (in seconds) your clone will exist. |
| *Cloneable:* Clone Limit          | Select to set a limit to how many clones you can create.     |
| *Cloneable:* Clone Dynamic Entity | Select to make the clone entity a dynamic entity.            |
| *Cloneable:* Clone Avatar Entity  | Select to specify if a cloned entity is created as an avatar entity. An avatar entity doesn't exist in the Entity Server. Instead, it is specific to a user's Interface client. For instance, say a user comes to visit the coffee shop in your domain. The user grabs a coffee cup that's been cloned. Once the user is done visiting, the cloned entity leaves with their avatar, ensuring there isn't any clutter left behind. This feature ensures that your entity is cloned locally for each avatar. |

## Set an Entity to Cast a Shadow

You can make your entity behave like a real world object by making it cast a shadow on other entities and avatars. Here are the different shadow settings you can configure:

| Behavior    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cast Shadow | Your entity will cast a shadow on other objects and avatars. |
