## Introduction

If you're interested in 3D modelling in virtual reality, you can checkout [Blocks](https://vr.google.com/blocks/). Blocks lets you create models easily regardless of your experience.

You can create something on [Blocks through Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/533970/Blocks_by_Google/) or download it for the headset you are using.

###Importing Your Model

1. Once you finish creating  your model, you can [publish it](https://vr.google.com/u/0/objects/2qIpIn0ZDjZ). ![](blocks-1.png)
2. Download your model from the Google Blocks website where it is published. ![](blocks-8.png)
3. Extract the zipped folder containing .obj and .mtl files. ![](blocks-2.png)
4. You can import the model into High Fidelity in two ways: Using a Hosting Service or Using Your Asset Server.
   - **Using  a Hosting Service**:
     + Upload the .obj and .mtl files to the hosting service you use. ![](blocks-3.png)
     + Copy the .obj's link to paste in High Fidelity. ![](blocks-4.png)
     + Open Interface and pull up your tablet.
     + Go to Create and select Model under the Create tab that opens.![](blocks-5.png)

   - **Using Your Asset Server**:
     +  In Interface, pull up your tablet.
     +  Go to Create and Click "Open this Domain's Asset Server". ![](open-asset-server.PNG)
     +  In the Asset Browser that opens up, click "Choose File" and select your .mtl and .obj files from their location. ![](choose-files.PNG)
     +  When you select and add the files, make sure to specify a folder name before the "/". Here, we typed "gazelle" to create a new folder. This can be a new or existing folder. Add both file paths and click OK.![](path1.PNG)![](path2.PNG)
     +  In the Asset Browser, select the .obj file and click "Add to World". ![](asset-browser.PNG)
     +  Select "Add" on the window that opens up. Your Blocks model will be added to your domain. ![](add-to-world.PNG)
