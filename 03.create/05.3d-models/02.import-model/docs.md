You can import a 3D model into High Fidelity by hosting it online or [hosting it on your Asset Server](../../../host/manage-your-domain-assets). When you host your 3D model on your Asset Server, it will not be available in other domains. If you wish to make your models available in other domains, it's best to host it online on cloud services.

## Import 3D Models Using a Hosting Service

If you wish to make your model [available for purchase on our Marketplace](../../../sell/add-item/upload-model), or make it available to users in other domains, you can host it on a cloud service of your choice and then import it.

1. Upload your 3D model's files to the hosting service of your choice.
2. Copy the OBJ or FBX file's URL.
3. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create**.
4. Select the 'Model' icon.
5. Paste the model URL you copied in step 2 and click 'Add'.


## Import 3D Models Using the Asset Server

You can [import your 3D model through your Asset Server](../../../host/manage-your-domain-assets#add-an-asset-to-the-asset-server). The Asset Server hosts files or assets that can either be added as-is to a domain or that are referenced by existing entities and scripts already in a domain. This is accessible only in a domain where you have the permission to create and edit an entity.

1. In Interface, pull up your HUD or Tablet and go to **Create**.
2. Click 'Open this Domain's Asset Server'.
3. The window that opens is called the Asset Browser. In the Asset Browser, click 'Choose File' to select your 3D model's files.
4. Enter a folder name to specify a path for your 3D model. This path should be added before the model's file name `/model_filename`. By default, there is no folder created for your asset. However, we recommend that you add folders for each of your models to help keep them organized.
5. In the Asset Browser, select the OBJ or FBX file and click 'Add to World'. Then, click 'Add' on the confirmation window that opens.
