3D models are [entities](../entities) that represent objects you'd like to see in-world such as a water fountain, a castle, or a coffee mug. You can get your 3D model by creating your own, sourcing it externally, or purchasing them from our [Marketplace](/explore/bank-and-shop#shopping-the-marketplace). We only support 3D models in the OBJ and FBX formats.

The appearance of a 3D model is controlled by its materials. The materials supported in High Fidelity are Physically-based Rendering (PBR) materials. This means that a 3D model's materials will reflect or absorb light as they would (approximately) in real life.
